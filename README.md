# Ops Guru Tech test

The goal for this test is to evaluate your proficiency in several different technologies and understand how deep you know them.
Here we are going to evaluate the following techs:

 - **Terraform**
 - **AWS**
 - **Containers** (eg: docker)
 - **Orchestration**
 - **Coding Skills**
 - **Documentation organization**
 - **Python**


# What is OpsGuru Tech test?

A list of technologies that combine will create a project helping us to evaluate your proficiency and speed on some techs.
You will find that inside the folder **test** there is a python file, a simple Flask sample that must be fixed.
We need that simple application working inside a EKS cluster on AWS.
Nothing can be done manually at the environment everything must be done by terraform

## Rules
Once you start the test you have 1 day to submit your PR for us.
You can have as many commits as needed and there is no execution limit for that project, just make sure that once the PR is created you finish your project.
**No need to create terraform MODULES be simple**
## Acceptance criteria

A PR must be submitted for appreciation, we will run your project and provide you a feedback around what was the result.

A documentation is also needed, so it's not all about code, we expect a comprehensive documentation about how to execute your project and what is the expected outcome for the it.
Please use the MarkDown formate for your documentation.
